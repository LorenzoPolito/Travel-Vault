Nagai Botanical Garden is an open-air botanical garden located in Osaka. Opened in 1974, it stretches over an area of 240,000sqm with a large lake in the center and is filled with different species of flowers and plants that change with the seasons. When the night falls, the garden grounds come alive with the immersive installations of teamLab’s permanent exhibition, turning into a surreal world of color and light.

  
teamLab is an international art collective that brings together art, science, technology, and nature. Through their work they seek to transcend the boundaries of the self and to find new ways of perceiving the world around us. teamLab’s art project Digitized Nature at Nagai Botanical Garden explores how non-material digital technology can turn nature into art without harming it, creating a space where human perception expands from the artwork itself to the environment.

The artworks in this exhibition transform interactively, influenced by wind and rain as well as the trees and birds that live in the garden. The behavior of the people who visit the exhibition is also active part of the installations. The artworks’ existence is not defined by their physical boundaries, but forms a continuity with the surrounding environment. In the same way that wildlife cannot be separated from its ecosystem, if people and natural elements disappear, the artworks will also disappear.

  
Exhibits include giant sculptures depicting the energy dissipated into the wind by the birds, ovoids that respond with light and sound when pushed by a person or blown by the wind, a field of lights that shine more brightly when people stand still near them, as well as limited-period artworks that follow the seasonal changes of the botanical garden.
